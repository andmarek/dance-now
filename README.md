# Dance Now, a rhythm focused game built in React

Have you ever wanted to play Flash Flash Revolution or some rhythm-based game on your Mac? Now that Flash is gone, you can't play that game in the browser.  AND since you bought that $3000 MacBookk, you can't run .exe files!  Oh no!! How can you keep your 1337 keyboard pressing skills??? :(

Well, now you can hopefully capture some of that nostalgia by playing Dance Now! 

This is a game to basically mimic [FlashFlashRevolution](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/), but in the browser.  

It's heavily a WIP and honestly who knows how it's gonna end up.  This has also probably been done before, but I haven't seen anything that is as good / reminded me of FlashFlashRevolution.

# Development
As stated, this is a work in progress.  I'm horrible at ReactJS, so this is going to take a while and the code quality might suffer from my noviceness.
